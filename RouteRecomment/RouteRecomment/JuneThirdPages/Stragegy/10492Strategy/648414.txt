            离开贵州，这是初到的阳朔西街&shy; &shy; &shy; 夜晚的西街&shy; &shy; &shy; 跟广州来的朋友去泡吧&shy; &shy; &shy; &shy; 隔壁旅馆上网的老外，每次回来看见他，姿势没变过……&shy; &shy; &shy; 划竹筏&shy; &shy; &shy; 一对老外把自行车也推上了船&shy; &shy; &shy; 这里貌似叫龙潭村&shy; &shy; &shy; &shy; &shy; &shy; &shy; &shy; 阳朔山水&shy; &shy; &shy; &shy; &shy; &shy; &shy; 又坐船&shy; &shy; &shy; &shy; 兴坪 漓江边一个古镇。这里只有街头几个小店，很恬淡的感觉。&shy; &shy; &shy; &shy; &shy; 也许这里，仿佛是十多年前的西街吧，很喜欢这个地方。&shy; &shy; &shy; &shy; &shy; &shy; &shy; 很欧式的感觉&shy; &shy; &shy; &shy; 起初和朋友一直纳闷，为什么这么美的一个古镇会没有商铺林立呢，在阳朔已经过滥的旅游大潮里，显得那么遗世独立。看到这个终于明白，这是街道墙壁上几次大水的水位标记。&shy; &shy; &shy; &shy; 却还是有人坚持留守在了家乡，一墙的照片，一个家族的美满和骄傲。&shy; &shy; &shy; 大吉大利&shy; &shy; &shy; 在这间小店坐到天黑才回城。就在今年，不久前大水也已经过腰，年轻的店老板却仍然选择留在这里。&shy; &shy; &shy; 老板是个小伙子，这是他养的一狗一猫，相当的亲密。前面镜头里出现过的两位老外也在这家小酒馆，用手势终于向我们说明了他们天晚没车回城，于是搭上了我朋友的便车，一起回到了灯红酒绿的阳朔。&shy; &shy; &shy; 龙脊梯田的瑶寨&shy; &shy; &shy; &shy; &shy; &shy; &shy; 织布的苗女&shy; &shy; &shy; 看见上面的字了吧――大厦落成。。汗~&shy; &shy; &shy; 耳洞被扯得这么大……&shy; &shy; &shy; 在住的客栈当了一回瑶女&shy; &shy; &shy; 然后去漂流，第一次，还翻船落水了，我可不会游泳呀。龙脊峡漂流最高落差一个4米，三个3米，其他大小落差无数，水流湍急，这张看起倒是很镇定，那是漂了快两个小时，已经习惯了……&shy; &shy; &shy; 帅吧，很冷也~&shy; &shy; &shy; 去黄姚古镇的路上，一路山水，很美哦~&shy; &shy; &shy; 清晨，客栈窗外的黄姚。&shy; &shy; &shy; 对面屋檐的仙人掌&shy; &shy; &shy; 大黄灯笼&shy; &shy; &shy; 黄姚故事&shy; &shy; &shy; 国鞋厂&shy; &shy; &shy; 鹦鹉眼药水&shy; &shy; &shy; 黄姚的三眼井&shy;  &shy; 台阶&shy; &shy; &shy; 洗菜的婆婆&shy; &shy; &shy; 张望&shy; &shy; &shy; 恍惚江南&shy; &shy; &shy; &shy; &shy; &shy; &shy; &shy; &shy; &shy; &shy; &shy; &shy; &shy; &shy; &shy; 蜻蜓是真的，不是P的，不是雕塑&shy; &shy; &shy; 写生的学生&shy; &shy; &shy; 附赠几张Eason演唱会，2010广州“90分的快活”演唱会。&shy; 从来没坐过这么好的演唱会位置，vip1区第五排正中，舞台又很近。可惜是又没带自己相机，这个是拿朋友的相机照的，没啥长焦。这是我第三次不带自己的单反看eason演唱会了，下次还是带吧。。。&shy; &shy; &shy; &shy; &shy; &shy; &shy; &shy; &shy; &shy; &shy;
